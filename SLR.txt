Simple Linear Regression

SLR= 
* Simple
	* 1 variable (1 **x**)
	* As compared to multiple linear regression (MLR), where there are multiple x's
* Linear
	* Linear combination of **β **
	* Linear model in those (not necessarily in x's)
* Regression
{{.\regression.png?width=500}}
Important: **ε** is independent identically distributed (**iid**)
* this is because sigma squared is constant (eg no i's attached)

GUITAR TIME
* I see a linear model
* I see assumptions (ass-umpt-ions) in epsilon
* Independent identically distributed
* Normal Zero sigma squared

"When we make estimates, we have to put the hat on"
* puts on a cowboy hat



E(y|x_{1}) = expected value of y given x_{1}
Line = Trend = Regression
Points don't actually exist on the line, it's just the expected value
