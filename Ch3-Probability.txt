===== Choosing a Model =====
Strategies:
* Genre specific model
* General model (eg polynomial)
* Piecewise regression (system of models)

We can also generalize this for any number of lines - each adds an indicator / adjustment factor

===== Null Hypothesis =====
"Skeptic's Belief"

Null hypothesis says 'there's nothing going on here, this is all just distributed normal'
From our model, we can generate a p-value
if p < 0.05, reject the null hypothesis and accept the model
if p > 0.05, we cannot reject the null hypothesis

We want a big p-value for ε ~ N(0, σ^{2})
