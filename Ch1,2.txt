====== Population vs Sample ======
* Population is what we really want
* Very hard to get information about it
	* one strategy: poll the entire population (census)
		* doesn't work very well
	* Another: math!
		* glean information about the population

== Population ==
* parameters
	* greek symbols, eg: μ σ π

== Sample ==
* Generate calculations from the sample (eg mean)
	* functions of the data
	* Value determined by the data (ie quality of sample)
	* these are known as **statistics**
	* They (can) **estimate population parameters**
		* eg: \hat{μ} = \bar{y}
		* eg: \hat{σ^{2}} = s^{2}  
	* english symbols, eg: \bar{y}

===== Unbiased Estimator =====
When the expected value of the estimator is what I'm trying to estimate:
E(\hat{ μ }) = μ

For sigma squared, the unbiased estimator is the **n - 1**
Unbiased:
s^{2} = Σ (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2} / (n - 1) = \hat{ σ^{2} }
\bar{x} = Σ x_{i} / n = \hat{ μ }

====== z Transformation ======

{{.\equation.png?type=equation}}

Meaning:
* Unitless (based on s.d.)
	* they just divide out, because s.d. is in the units of the measurement
* number of standard deviations it is away from the mean
	* **Statistical Distance**

{{.\equation001.png?type=equation}}
* z can be positive or negative

===== Proofs =====

== mean(z) = 0 ==

{{.\equation002.png?type=equation}} by definition
{{.\equation003.png?type=equation}}

Therefore:
{{.\equation004.png?type=equation}}

== variance(z) = 1 ==

{{.\equation005.png?type=equation}} by definition
{{.\equation006.png?type=equation}}

====== Empircal Rule ======

\bar{x}, s^2 are point estimates

**Assumptions:**
* Unimodal distribution (one hump)
* Symmetrical about the mode (looks 'normal', eg one side reflects onto the other about the 'hump')

**Then:**
* approx. 68% of the distribution lies within 1 s.d. of the mean
* approx. 95% of the distribution lies within 2 s.d. of the mean
* approx. 99% of the distribution lies within 3 s.d. of the mean

====== Chebychev Rule ======
